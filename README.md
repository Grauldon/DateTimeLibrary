# Date Time Library

I started this project a couple of years ago when I decided to begin coding again. I am revisiting it to continue 
developing my skills in the C-programming language. I was learning about dynamic-link libraries when I first started 
the project, so it incorporates that approach.

The project is still a work-in-progress. I plan to add functionality to perform date and time arithmetic and other 
useful features for processing dates and time.
